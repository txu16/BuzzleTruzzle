Buzzle Truzzle

Note: When I say "ball" I really mean a square.

This is a very VERY simplified version of Bubble Trouble on MiniClip. Instead of shooting a vine, you jump to hit the ball, and instead of the ball splitting into two, it just becomes smaller. You have to jump and hit the ball at least 3 times to win (until the ball disappears).

You will use the left and right arrows to move left and right. You will press "Z" to jump and hit the ball. If the ball hits you while you're not jumping, you lose. You may press "Backspace" to exit to starting screen at any time.
